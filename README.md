# Personal-Site
I initially built my site using React.js with create-react-app, to better familiarize myself with React.
I decided that I wanted to implement a search feature to search my various projects and settled on using [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/).
After deciding that I'd like to perhaps make a blog on the site at some point, I researched SEO considerations for React
and decided that using Gatsby would be a good solution because its server rendered pages are available to search bots.
